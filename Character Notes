just notes for characters nothing codey in here

Cyan: Probably will be similar to Gerik and show up holding her promotion item but be a knight. 
To give players a choice. Although if she shows up early game probably best for her to be a knight instead for balance.

Sonic Unleashed: Current growths are assuming dancers can't really attack. If we can get them to attack growths 
should equal about 275-280% but if they can't attack aim for 350% growths. Probably joins chapter 13

Wolfy: will probably be classified as a manakete and use the flame dog sprite as her attack animation. 
Only has access to one weapon but will be compensated for in her growths
